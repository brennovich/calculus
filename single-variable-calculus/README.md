# Single Variable Calculus

Personal notes regarding **MIT Open Course Ware**'s _Single Variable Calculus_.

## Course Goals

1. Derivatives as rates of change, computed as a limit of ratios
2. Integrals as a "sum," computed as a limit of Riemann sums

After completing this course, students should demonstrate competency in the following skills:

- [ ] Use both the limit definition and rules of differentiation to differentiate functions.
- [ ] Sketch the graph of a function using asymptotes, critical points, the derivative test for increasing/decreasing functions, and concavity.
- [ ] Apply differentiation to solve applied max/min problems.
- [ ] Apply differentiation to solve related rates problems.
- [ ] Evaluate integrals both by using Riemann sums and by using the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
- [ ] Apply integration to compute arc lengths, volumes of revolution and surface areas of revolution.
- [ ] Evaluate integrals using advanced techniques of integration, such as inverse substitution, partial fractions and integration by parts.
- [ ] Use L'Hospital's rule to evaluate certain indefinite forms.
- [ ] Determine convergence/divergence of improper integrals and evaluate convergent improper integrals.
- [ ] Determine the convergence/divergence of an infinite series and find the Taylor series expansion of a function near a point.
